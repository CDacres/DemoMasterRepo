Not everyone in an office needs desk space all at once, especially with today's more flexible office hours, so companies can often reduce the number of desks they have. It's particularly valuable in cities where office rents are high, which explains why hot desking in London is so popular.<p><b>Flexibility</b><p>Hot desking lends itself to a range of business dynamics. Many companies make the change to hot desking if they start expanding at a rapid rate.
