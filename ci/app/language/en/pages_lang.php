$lang["pages_about_story_heading"]="The Story Behind Zipcube";
$lang["pages_about_story_text"]="Zipcube was founded by Guillaume Santacruz in the Google campus in London. Keen user of workspaces, He was wasting too much time contacting each venue individually, but also knew from experience that a lot of companies have extra space that they could rent. Thus, he decided to create a company which would combine an easy booking system with a very customisable interface for venue owners and individuals in order to share their unused spaces. The result of this is Zipcube. We are a diverse team of highly-qualified and enthusiastic people all aiming to turn private office and venue space into an easy to use online booking system. Our goal is to provide an accessible, easy to compare and affordable booking system for any space with a strong focus on quality and value-for-money.

$lang["pages_faq_section_why_zipcube"]="Why Zipcube?";
$lang["pages_faq_section_why_zipcube_text"]="Zipcube is the web's first online marketplace to help people find and book short-term meeting, office and event spaces. Our mission is to provide space seekers an easy to use platform with up-to-date venue information that converts users into real-time bookings. Most importantly, we make it easy for users to search and book a space.";
$lang["pages_faq_section_how_does"]="How does Zipcube work for venue owners?";
$lang["pages_faq_section_how_does_text"]="Each venue owner will register and start completing the venue registration form to create bookable listing. Zipcube will approve and publish the new listing within 24 hours. After that, Zipcube will either send you direct bookings which you can either accept or reject. We then process the payment and send you the proceeds. There is absolutely no risk.";
$lang["pages_faq_section_how_much"]="How much does Zipcube charge for use of the platform?";
$lang["pages_faq_section_how_much_text"]="For users, booking is 100% FREE. For venue owners, It is FREE to list your venue and use our tools. When someone reserves your space, Zipcube withholds a 15% processing fee for the space rental (varies based on venue size). That's it.";
$lang["pages_faq_section_is_there"]="Is there a limit to the numbers of spaces that I can post?";
$lang["pages_faq_section_is_there_text"]="No - we don't limit the number or types of spaces we accept in the marketplace. Zipcube supports listing multiple spaces per venue; each space will have its own profile page. For venues with multiple locations, you will need a separate account for each. It's one account per venue!";
$lang["pages_faq_section_what_are"]="What are the rules for listing a venue?";
$lang["pages_faq_section_what_are_text"]="Zipcube verifies each venue owners in order to provide the best quality listing. To prevent fraud or abuse, Zipcube reviews every profile for validity and confirms all contact information before making your profile live. Other than that, we only ask that you complete the venue registration by including photos, pricing, and venue amenities. The better your profile, the more likely it is to attract customers.";
$lang["pages_faq_section_how_do"]="How do I get paid for reservations?";
$lang["pages_faq_section_how_do_text"]="Zipcube remits all booking proceeds to venues via check at the beginning of each month. Under the Account/Payment menu, you need to complete the simple form with information on who/where to send payment.";

$lang["pages_faq_section_how_should_text"]="You should price your spaces / offices to be attractive and competitive with other venues. Zipcube is positioned as a marketplace for space and encourages venues to discount when possible. For example, a typical hourly rate for a boardroom space that holds 10 people might be £40/hr, where a typical full-day rate would be £200. Our vision is to provide the best online marketplace to maximise the occupancy rate of each venue.";
$lang["pages_faq_section_how_long"]="How long can I list my space?";
